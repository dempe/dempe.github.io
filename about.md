This site's title, {{ site.title | escape }} (pronounced show-sheen), is a Zen concept roughly translated as "beginner's mind."  It implies curiosity, openness, and approaching things without preconceptions.  It is the aim of this blog to survey a variety of topics, always through the eyes of a beginner.
