Writing is a highly effective means of exploring the infinitely vast and interesting place that is our world.  Thus, this blog was born as a compendium of my thoughts.

The title, 初心 or shoshin (pronounced show-sheen), is a Zen concept roughly translated as "beginner's mind".  A beginner's mind is a mind of limitless curiosity and openness.  In a beginner's mind, learning is unhampered by preconceptions and everything is always new.  To quote Shunryu Suzuki in his book, *Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind*, "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few."  The aim of this blog is to explore the world through the eyes of a beginner, never an expert.
