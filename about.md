I don't really know what I know until I write it. Writing is, for me, a reflection of my thoughts, and this blog my mirror.

The title, 初心 or shoshin (pronounced show-sheen), is a Zen concept roughly translated as "beginner's mind".  It implies curiosity, openness, and approaching things without preconceptions.  To quote Shunryu Suzuki in his book, _Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind_, "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few."  It is the aim of this blog to approach things through the eyes of a beginner.
