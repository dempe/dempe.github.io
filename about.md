I'm Chris Dempewolf, yet another software engineer (YASE) based in Seattle. I set up this blog with the primary purpose of exploring my thoughts and my interests via writing. My interests err on the side of breadth rather than depth, but a few of my biggest are biology, computation, and culture.

This site's title, <span lang="ja">{{ site.title | escape }}</span> (pronounced sho-sheen), is a Zen concept roughly translated as "beginner's mind."  It implies curiosity, openness, and approaching things without preconceptions.  It is the goal of this blog to explore a variety of new and interesting topics - always through the eyes of a beginner.

Thanks for visiting.  You can reach me at chrisdempewolf at protonmail dot com.
