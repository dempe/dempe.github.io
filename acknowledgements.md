The CSS styling, underlining, and beautiful English fonts I took from the [Tufte CSS project](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css), while the designs and fonts themselves were originally created by Edward Tufte, himself. The Japanese font used for regular text is available at the [Source Han Serif project](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/tree/release/OTF), and the font for the title is available at [OpenType.jp](https://opentype.jp/kouzangyousho.htm). 

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
