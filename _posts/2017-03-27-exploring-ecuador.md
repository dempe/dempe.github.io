I spent nine days in continental Ecuador. In those nine days, I tried several foods and drinks, visited numerous towns, made many new friends, and learned some Spanish.

Ecuador has 4 main regions: the Galapagos, the Andean sierra, the coast, and the rain forest. I visited the last three.

One of the first things I noticed about Ecuador was the great variety of food, some of which is only sold in certain areas.  But if you think about it, this makes sense - the country is so small and geographically diverse, the food is easily transported and is as diverse as the geography. For example, I ate tilapia cooked in bijao leaves (similar to banana leaves) called _maito_, a Colombian dish of fried trucha (trout) called _pescado aborrajado_, and fried worms called _chontacuros_ in the rainforest.  In the Andean region, for breakfast, I had a scrambled eggs-like dish made out of plantains and pork called _tigrillo_, a chicken and rice dish called _seco de pollo_, and _guatita_ or tripe over rice in a special sauce. In the coastal region, I enjoyed a fish stew called _encebollado_. And throughout the trip, I endulged in fruit "milkshakes" called _batidos_ and _canelazo_, an alocoholic beverage mixed with sugar cane juice (tasted like alcoholic apple sauce).

Like the geography, Ecuador's culture is I visited some thermal baths (Quito is surrounded by volcanoes), a cave in the jungle, a giant cathedral, and an artisanal market run by the native Ecuadorean people, Kichwa, where I haggled for a lot a various stuff (you can haggle for almost everything in Ecuador).

The towns I visited: Quito, Otavalo, Archidona, Puya, Guayaquil, Pelileo, Los Baños, Ambato, Los Playas, Tena, and some others whose name has escaped my memory.

Probably my favorite place that I visited was the La Capilla del Hombre ("The Chapel of Man"). It is a large museum that Ecuador's most famous artist, Oswaldo Guayasamín, planned throughout his lifetime on his estate overlooking Quito. Dedicated to the almost unending Latin American suffering from dictatorships, war, and 1st world exploitation over the past few centuries, The Capilla del Hombre starts out with Guayasamín's "kinetic" works (ones that have moving pieces that can be mixed and matched). It then leads to a room with a view overlooking Quito and features some of his Quito portraits (e.g., Quito rojo and Quito azul (he painted numerous pictures of Quito depending on the mood he was in)). You then go into a hallway with more kinetic paintings and some "anti"-religious works (Guaysamín was an atheist and he re-painted some famous Christian paintings devoid of all religious symbolism). You then enter the "pre-Hispania" room, the center piece of the entire exhibit. I *really* liked pre-Hispania for all of it's mythological themes: Mayan-inspired chairs, serpents, the sun and moon, the mother goddess, the condor and the bull (symbolic of Native Americans fighting the Spanish, but also, I felt, very Daoist), centered by the eternal flame. The Pre-Hispania is circular and rises out of the cubical chapel -- this, I felt, was symbolic of the inner essence of humanity and humanity's ability to overcome (especially reflected against Guayasamín's painting, "The Dictator's Smile"). In The Dictator's Smile, the dictator's head is square unlike the head of anyone else in his paintings (he mostly painted the oppressed) symbolizing his inhumanity.
