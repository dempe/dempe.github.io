excerpt: A slower metabolism leads to a longer life. Here's why.
---

During lunch with a friend, I mentioned that, by eating less, you can lower your metabolism and having a lower metabolism is in your best interest. He looked confused and said, "I thought it was better to have a high metabolism." This was my response.

### When is it better to have a high metabolism?

If you are overweight, then having a higher metabolism is better. Excess body weight is more damaging than a high metabolism. The higher your metabolism, the more energy you burn, the less weight you put on.

The reason that so many people naively assume that a higher metabolism is better is because they only ever hear about metabolism in the context of weight lose. In the U.S., as of 2014, 70.7% of people aged 20 and older were overweight,[^1] and as of 2016, 39.8% of people age 20 and older were obese.[^2] Based on these numbers, it would be better, on average, if Americans increased their metabolism. It's no wonder then that all you hear about are the merits of an increased metabolism.

### Slow It Down

However, if you are not overweight, the slower your metabolism, the longer your life expectancy. To start, let me give a reductionistic definition for what it means to be a living thing. As a living being, all you are is a machine for transforming energy into order. Your entire life's purpose is simply to expel entropy.{%

   note='But wait. The second law of thermodynamics says that entropy can only increase. Yes, _net_ entropy increases as we expel entropy, but _effective_ entropy in our pocket of the universe decreases. We are essentially moving entropy (and creating more) to create meaningful order in our world.'
   id='entropy'
%} When you read, you create order in your neurons. When you go to work, you create order for your company. When you mow the lawn, you order your grass. To reiterate, all we are is an energy transformation machine.

Unfortunately, we are given a finite quota of energy that we can consume before we break down. When this quota runs out, we die. In other words, the length of our life is determined not by time but by the amount of energy that we can consume.{%

   note='This is assuming death by natural causes.'
   id='death'
%} Therefore, the more quickly we consume energy, the more quickly we run through our quota and, eventually, die.

Now, living things, unlike non-living things, get a special name for when they consume energy. We call it metabolism. Since faster energy consumption leads to a shorter life and metabolism is just another name for energy consumption, it follows that a faster metabolism leads to a shorter life.

### Examples

Nature is rife with examples of the correlation between a slow metabolism and a long life. The slow moving, but long lived tortoise immediately comes to mind along with whales and elephants. On the other end of the spectrum, rats, who metabolize energy very quickly, rarely live for more than three years.
