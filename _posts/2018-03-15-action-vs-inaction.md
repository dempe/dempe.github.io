excerpt: Why it is better to take action than not
---

A guiding principle of my life over the past few months has been to prefer action over inaction, or, more colloquially, YOLO. In this essay, I hope to distill some of the reasons why it is better to prefer action over inaction.

Start with the question of what are knowledge and knowhow and how do they differ.{% include side_note.html

     note="Psychologists refer to knowledge and knowhow as _descriptive knowledge_ and _procedural knowledge_, respectively. They are both, technically, subtypes of knowledge, but I am attempting to use less esoteric rhetoric."
%}Knowledge is a collection of declarative facts about an entity. Knowhow is knowledge of a process and how to perform that process. To put it more simply, knowledge answers the question of _what_; knowhow answers the question of _how_. Knowledge is far more easily obtained (and thus less valuable) than knowhow.{% include side_note.html

     note="For example, anyone can pick up a book and read how to ride a bike.  They will know all about riding a bike and could tell you how to peddle, steer, and change gears, but if they have never ridden a bike they will not be able to get on a bike and actually ride one themselves. Thus, knowhow can only be obtain through practice, through experience."
